"""
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".

Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 300
- 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
- 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
- s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of wordDict are unique.
