"""
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= nums.length
